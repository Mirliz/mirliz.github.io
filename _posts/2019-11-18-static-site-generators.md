This was the first time for me using a static site generator to create a web site, and the thing that hit me was how it can be at the same time simple and advanced. The learning curve was pretty steep since I'm mostly used to Wordpress and Joomla, but the structure and functionality of it all is very straightforward.

What I loved the most was Markdown language! Unfortunately I haven't fully explored it yet on this web site, but I have studied it in detail and can't wait until I get the opportunity to really dive into it.

I can definitely see the advantages of creating web sites with a static site generator such as Jekyll. For smaller web sites or blogs that don't need to rely on dynamic content, SSGs offer much in terms of performance or setting up on the server (good-bye databases!). I could see myself using an SSG to create web sites for all kinds of organizations and smaller companies that, as I said, don't need dynamic content functionality - or even personal or professional blogs, now that there are services like Disqus for blog comments.
