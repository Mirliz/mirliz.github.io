My name is Mirjam Arvidsson and I live in a small city called Nora north of Örebro, where I recently moved together with my fiancé.

One would think that at age 31 I would already have an education and a permanent job, but alas, no. So what have I been up to?
To summarize the past 10+ years (sort of) quickly:

In 2008-2011 I studied Digital Media Design at Örebro University and ended up with a Bachelor of Arts in Media and Communication Studies.
Then I had a couple of work experience placements before spontaneously applying for a Japanese Language School in Tokyo in 2012.
I was accepted, so in July 2012 I moved halfway across the world, where I learned some Japanese, made a few wonderful friends and 
just experiencecd as much as I could of what Japanese culture offered.

In October 2013 I returned to Sweden. Since then I have worked in the office of a private home care for elderly company, 
worked as a substitute teacher in pre-school (age 1-5) and I even started studying to become a pre-school teacher. Sadly I've come 
to realize that sort of workplace is not the place for me, however fun I might find it (and I do find it tremendously fun).

So I thought, why not complete my previous digital media design education with a web programming education? And here I am!

I do have a few more interests other than web design and Japan. The main ones are reading and music - all sorts of music. I listen to 
this and that, I sing karaoke, I play the piano and the flute, I've been in choirs and orchestras.

I'm also sort of a fantasy and sci-fi geek. I can probably come up with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Doctor Who references in almost 
any kind of situation.
